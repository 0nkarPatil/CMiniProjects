README FOR STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM (HOSTEL)
====================================

Features : 
===========
	
	Provides User Friendly Graphical User Interface to end Users with the help of GTK3.0. So it will be more easy to End Users to deal with data store in files in an efficient way.



Solutions : 
===========

	A very common and simple solution used is FILE HANDLING and dividing problems in to similar parts i.e files. Using files to store data row wise and using space as delimiter to seperate columns. Accessing data row wise as a whole record and performing appropriate operations like delete or edit. 


Different files : (srs - Student Record System )
=================

"srs.h", "srs.c", "srsfun.c", "mainprog.c".

File "srs.h"	   -- containd typedef of record , prototypes of methods, global variables like fp, ft, rec.

File "srs.c"	   -- contains implementation of prototype of header file. 

File "mainprog.c"  -- contains main() which intializes gtk window for the first.
